3.4.6 2022-05-18
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* fixed issues in build system
* improved error messages and fixed several small bugs
* added milliseconds in time variable output for tropomi
* restore version with solar angles for bira-airborne

3.4.5 2021-01-21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* update of reading routine for gome-2 due to an update of .codadef files. 
* Ground-based measurements : add the wanted saa convention if angles are recalculated for a specific observation site

3.4.4 2020-09-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* MFC format : fix issue with the selection of reference spectra
* Windows OS : 'save plot' in ascii systematically added 'asc' extension even if not wanted


3.4 2020-02-28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ground-based measurements : FRM4DOAS netCDF format
* TROPOMI/GOMEnetCDF : use earthshine radiance as reference spectrum. This spectrum should be generated outside QDOAS in APEX netCDF format
* addition of Pukite/Slope and Ring molecular correction terms in the analysis windows properties
* possibility to calculate the difference of cross sections instead of orthogonalize them
